## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

The basic Sudoku problem can be modelled with constraint programming by a combination of all different constraints. Using different consistency techniques for these constraints we derive a number of propagation schemes with differing strength. We can extend the model either by shaving, testing each
value in each domain with a one-step lookahead technique or by adding redundant constraints.
